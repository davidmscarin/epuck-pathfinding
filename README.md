training a agent to learn to navigate an unknown environment in order to find the optimal path from a random origin position to a known target while avoiding obstacles. The agent is a Webots ”e-puck” robot and the training and testing were simulated in a custom Webots world. We experiment with a PPO and a DQN where the robot's observations consist of its LIDAR readings.

Please see project report (pdf) for a more in depth description.
